                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    Tiisetso Sebola is the name. I originate from the Limpopo province in Polokwane but later moved to Cape Town in pursuit of sharpening my culinary skills as we all know that it is the culinary capital of South Africa.
                I had to choose between cooking and architecture but really, cooking is way better than drawing houses. There is an art in it.&nbsp
Being a chef has always and forever been something I always wanted to pursue because I am very passionate about food and cooking.My motherâ€™s cooking made me fall in love with food; she is an amazing cook! I would watch her make breads and watch the technicality behind her cooking.</p>
